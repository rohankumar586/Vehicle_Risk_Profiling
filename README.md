# Car Risk Rating Predictor: Revolutionizing Auto Insurance with Data Analytics - MGSC 661 Project

## Introduction
In the complex realm of auto insurance, accurately assessing the risk associated with different vehicles is key to setting fair and competitive premiums. This is where my Car Risk Rating Predictor comes into play. It's not just a tool; it's a groundbreaking approach to redefining how insurance companies evaluate car-related risks.

## The Solution: Car Risk Rating Predictor
The Car Risk Rating Predictor is a model that utilizes detailed car features to predict the risk rating of vehicles. This prediction is instrumental in helping assess a risk rating to car and helping insurance companies to calculate premiums more accurately and efficiently.

## How It Works
- **Data Gathering and Exploration**: I choose this dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/toramky/automobile-dataset?resource=download). This dataset includes elements like make, body style, engine size, horsepower, and more, which are critical in determining a car's risk profile.
- **Model Development**: Using machine learning techniques, I developed a predictive model that correlates these features with the risk rating of the car. The model was tested and refined to ensure high accuracy (accuracy of 70%) and reliability.
- **Practical Application**: The predictor is designed to provide a quick and accurate risk rating, allowing for more precise premium calculations.

## The Impact
This model offers a transformative approach to vehicle risk assessment, providing benefits such as:
- **For Insurance Companies**: Enhanced accuracy in risk assessment, leading to fairer and more competitive insurance premiums.
- **For Consumers**: More transparent and individualized pricing, reflecting the specific risk profile of their vehicle.

## Conclusion
The Car Risk Rating Predictor marks a significant step forward in the intersection of data analytics and insurance. It showcases how sophisticated data analysis can lead to more informed and equitable decision-making in the insurance industry.

## Technical Details
- Data Cleaning and Imputation: Employed regression modelling and other techniques to impute missing values and prepare the data for analysis.
- Feature Selection and Multicollinearity Analysis: Utilized Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and Random Forest algorithm for feature selection, and removed highly collinear variables to assess feature importance.
- Understanding Variable Distribution: Analyzed the distribution of variables through various graphical methods to gain insights into their characteristics and relationships.
- Model Selection: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was used as the primary model due to the categorical nature of the target variable. 
- Clustering Analysis: Applied hierarchical and K-means clustering to identify distinct groups of vehicles, aiding in risk assessment.

## Results and Discussion
- Model Performance: The model achieved an accuracy of 70% demonstrating strong capability in predicting vehicle risk ratings with high specificity and balanced accuracy.
- Clustering Insights: Provided valuable insights into different vehicle groupings, which can be used for targeted insurance product development.
